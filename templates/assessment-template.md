# Learning Objectives: [ASSESSMENT NAME]

**Assessment Branch**: `[###-assessment-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Learning objectives description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse learning objectives from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No learning objectives provided"
2. Extract key competencies from description
   ‚Üí Identify: skills, knowledge, performance criteria, contexts
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill Learning Evidence & Assessment section
   ‚Üí If no clear evidence pathway: ERROR "Cannot determine how competency will be demonstrated"
5. Generate Competency Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be observable and measurable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Skills (if procedural learning involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Assessment has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If assessment method details found: ERROR "Remove specific tools/methods"
8. Return: SUCCESS (assessment ready for framework design)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT students should demonstrate and WHY it matters
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to assess (no specific tools, rubrics, or implementation methods)
- üë• Written for educational stakeholders, not assessment technicians

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every assessment
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the learning context
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating learning objectives from an educator prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "writing skills" without genre or context), mark it
3. **Think like an assessor**: Every vague objective should fail the "observable and measurable" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - Student population and grade level
   - Prior knowledge assumptions
   - Performance criteria and standards
   - Context and application settings
   - Accommodation requirements
   - Transfer and generalization expectations

## Learning Evidence & Assessment *(mandatory)*

### Primary Learning Journey
[Describe the main pathway students will take to demonstrate competency in plain language]

### Evidence Collection Scenarios
1. **Given** [learning context], **When** [student demonstrates], **Then** [expected evidence]
2. **Given** [assessment context], **When** [student performs], **Then** [observable outcome]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [student struggles with prerequisite skills]?
- How does assessment handle [different learning styles or needs]?

## Competency Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Learning Objectives
- **LO-001**: Students MUST demonstrate [specific competency, e.g., "ability to analyze cause-effect relationships"]
- **LO-002**: Students MUST show [specific skill, e.g., "effective peer collaboration"]  
- **LO-003**: Students MUST be able to [key performance, e.g., "transfer learning to new contexts"]
- **LO-004**: Students MUST exhibit [behavioral outcome, e.g., "metacognitive reflection on learning process"]
- **LO-005**: Students MUST display [content mastery, e.g., "understanding of core scientific principles"]

*Example of marking unclear objectives:*
- **LO-006**: Students MUST demonstrate writing proficiency at [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: grade level standard not specified - what genre, length, audience?]
- **LO-007**: Students MUST show mathematical reasoning in [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: context not specified - what type of problems?]

### Key Competencies *(include if assessment involves skill demonstration)*
- **[Competency 1]**: [What it involves, observable behaviors without specific assessment methods]
- **[Competency 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other learning areas]
