# Assessment Framework: [ASSESSMENT NAME]

**Branch**: `[###-assessment-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Learning Objectives**: [link]
**Input**: Learning objectives from `/assessments/[###-assessment-name]/assessment.md`

## Execution Flow (/validate command scope)
```
1. Load learning objectives from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No learning objectives at {path}"
2. Fill Assessment Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Assessment Type from context (performance=portfolio+presentation, formative=ongoing+feedback)
   → Set Structure Decision based on assessment type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Equity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Redesign for accessibility first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → rubrics/, competency-model.md, activities.md, agent-specific template file
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe activity generation approach (DO NOT create activities.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /execute command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /validate command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /execute command creates activities.md
- Phase 3-4: Assessment implementation (manual or via tools)

## Summary
[Extract from learning objectives: primary competencies + assessment approach from research]

## Assessment Context
**Grade Level/Population**: [e.g., 9th grade, Adult learners, Mixed ages or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Subject Area**: [e.g., Biology, Mathematics, Language Arts or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Duration**: [e.g., 2 weeks, Semester-long, Single class period or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Assessment Methods**: [e.g., Portfolio, Performance task, Peer evaluation or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Setting**: [e.g., Classroom, Online, Community-based or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Assessment Type**: [formative/summative/authentic - determines structure]  
**Success Criteria**: [domain-specific, e.g., Proficient on state standards, Demonstrates transfer, Shows growth or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., Time limits, Resource availability, Accommodation needs or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 30 students, District-wide, Individual assessment or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: [#] (max 3 - e.g., api, cli, tests)
- Using framework directly? (no wrapper classes)
- Single data model? (no DTOs unless serialization differs)
- Avoiding patterns? (no Repository/UoW without proven need)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? (no direct app code)
- Libraries listed: [name + purpose for each]
- CLI per library: [commands with --help/--version/--format]
- Library docs: llms.txt format planned?

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? (test MUST fail first)
- Git commits show tests before implementation?
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed?
- Real dependencies used? (actual DBs, not mocks)
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas?
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included?
- Frontend logs → backend? (unified stream)
- Error context sufficient?

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? (MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD)
- BUILD increments on every change?
- Breaking changes handled? (parallel tests, migration plan)

# Option 3: Mobile + API (when "iOS/Android" detected)

```

**Structure Decision**: [DEFAULT to Option 1 unless Technical Context indicates web/mobile app]

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/update-agent-context.sh [claude|gemini|copilot]` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
