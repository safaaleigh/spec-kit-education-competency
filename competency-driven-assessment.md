# Competency-Driven Assessment (CDA)

## Overview
Transform educational evaluation from standardized testing to comprehensive skill validation.

## The Pattern
- `/assess` command converts learning objectives into multi-modal evaluation workflows
- `/validate` generates portfolio systems, performance tasks, and authentic assessments
- Constitutional constraints ensure fair evaluation across different learning styles and backgrounds
- Templates prevent bias and enforce comprehensive skill demonstration

## Example Application
Student evaluation becomes an executable specification that generates:
- Project-based assessments that require application of knowledge to real-world problems
- Self-reflection frameworks that help students evaluate their own learning and growth
- Peer evaluation systems where students assess and provide feedback on each other's work
- Portfolio organization tools that collect and present evidence of learning over time
- Competency tracking dashboards that show progress across multiple skills and subjects
- Performance rubrics that clearly define expectations and provide detailed feedback

## Key Benefits
- **Authentic Assessment**: Evaluation methods that mirror real-world application of knowledge and skills
- **Multiple Modalities**: Various ways for students to demonstrate learning based on their strengths
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Assessment of both content knowledge and transferable skills
- **Student Agency**: Learners take ownership of documenting and reflecting on their growth
- **Fair and Inclusive**: Assessment methods that work for diverse learning styles and backgrounds

## Constitutional Constraints
- Multiple assessment methods required to accommodate different learning styles
- Student self-reflection and metacognition mandatory components of evaluation
- Real-world application and transfer of learning must be demonstrated
- Bias prevention measures required in all assessment design and implementation
- Growth and improvement valued equally with achievement levels

## Template Categories
- **Performance Tasks**: Real-world applications that demonstrate knowledge and skill transfer
- **Portfolio Systems**: Comprehensive collection and organization of learning evidence over time
- **Self-Assessment**: Frameworks for student reflection and evaluation of their own learning
- **Peer Evaluation**: Structured systems for students to assess and provide feedback to classmates
- **Competency Tracking**: Dashboards and tools for monitoring skill development across domains

## Success Metrics
- Increased student engagement and ownership of learning assessment
- Better correlation between assessment results and real-world skill application
- More equitable evaluation outcomes across diverse student populations
- Enhanced student metacognitive awareness and self-regulation skills
- Improved teacher understanding of individual student strengths and growth areas
