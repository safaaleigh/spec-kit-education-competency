# Assessment Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Multiple Assessment Modalities (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Every assessment must accommodate different learning styles and abilities. No single assessment method can be the sole measure of student competency. Include at least three different ways for students to demonstrate their understanding: performance tasks, portfolio evidence, peer evaluation, self-reflection, or authentic application.

### II. Authentic Assessment Focus
Every assessment must connect to real-world application of knowledge and skills. Students should be able to see the relevance and transfer value of what they're demonstrating. Avoid artificial or contrived assessment scenarios that exist only in academic contexts.

### III. Student Agency and Voice
Students must have opportunities for self-assessment, goal-setting, and reflection on their learning journey. Assessment should increase student ownership and metacognitive awareness, not just measure performance. Include student choice in how they demonstrate competency when possible.

### IV. Bias Prevention and Equity
All assessments must be reviewed for cultural, linguistic, and socioeconomic bias. Multiple pathways to success must be available. Accommodations and supports should be built into the design, not added as afterthoughts. Assessment should reveal student strengths, not just deficits.

### V. Growth-Oriented Evaluation
Assessment must value progress and improvement equally with achievement levels. Include mechanisms to track learning growth over time. Feedback should be actionable and support continued learning, not just judge current performance.
